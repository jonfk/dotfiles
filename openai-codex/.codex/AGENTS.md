## Ambiguity handling
- Before any implementation or edits, ask clarifying questions if requirements, inputs, or constraints are unclear.
- If there is more than one way to solve a problem. Offer 2–3 viable options with trade-offs and recommend one if there is a clear best one.

## Plan-first workflow
- Propose a plan before implementation and seek approval.
