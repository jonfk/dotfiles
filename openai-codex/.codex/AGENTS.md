## Ambiguity handling
- Before any implementation or edits, ask clarifying questions if requirements, inputs, or constraints are unclear
- If there is more than one way to solve a problem. Offer 2–3 viable options with trade-offs and recommend one if there is a clear best one

## Plan Research
- Plan research can use any read only tools it needs without seeking approval
- Find all the information that would be relevant to the plan and ensure you have all the context before proposing a plan

## Plan-first workflow
- Propose a plan before implementation and seek approval
